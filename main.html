	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity describes how an algorithm’s runtime grows with input size, helping you judge whether a solution is efficient. It guides
		you in choosing approaches that scale well instead of slowing down as data increases.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> describes how much extra memory an algorithm uses, and if it’s O(n), the space grows directly with the input size. It’s basically a reminder not to write
		code that hoards memory like it’s preparing for an apocalypse.</p>
